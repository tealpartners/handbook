# Values 
The name **Teal Partners** is based on a color scheme Frederic Laloux is used in his book "Reinventing Organizations". He uses colors to describe the way companies are organized.


## Self-management aka flatland
>Driven by peer relations and an "advice principle".

With the advice principle, the right people make decisions at the right level with the input from relevant and knowledgeable colleagues.
We're convinced that this will lead to better decision making because it uses the power of collective intelligence. And as a side effect it will stimulate responsibility, involvement and entrepreneurship.

One of the best examples of this principle is the involvement of the entire team in the recruitment process. Everyone is invited to participate during interviews and negotiations. 
In an open discussion with the interested partners we decide whether this person is a match. If you have a typical enterprise background this might sound a bit extreme. One might think that it sounds like a hippie fairytale, but we just see it as next level organizational managment. You could also say that the founders of Teal Partners just use a [high level of delegation](https://medium.com/@jurgenappelo/the-7-levels-of-delegation-672ec2a48103)

Like Steve Jobs once said: _"It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do. We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do"._


## Evolutionary purpose: 
>Let the organization adapt and grow, not be driven.

At Teal Partners, we aim to create a place where motivated and talented individuals can grow and achieve personal goals. 
Everybody in the organization must have the profound feeling it is their company and every colleague should be at ease in the Teal Partners environment.

An important aspect of being able to choose our own path, is the fact that we are completely self-funded. We don't depend on VCs, we don't have debt (profitable from year one!).
If we want to invest our profit in something we believe in, we have the full autonomy to do so.

## Wholeness
>Involving the whole person at work, for real.

We try to establish a "caring culture" where personal and organizational goals correspond. We believe this will lead to an engaged population and a high performance organization.

It feels liberating that you don't have to wear a mask at work. This can go from the very trivial things like casual clothing (slippers and shorts in the summer), adding your favorite drink to the grocery list (be it rosehip tea or Sprite) to more professional related things. If you are most productive on the edge of chaos: piles of papers on your desk while surrounded by a post-it mosaic, empty coke cans everywhere, nobody will force a clean desk policy on you. 
When you are not exactly the earliest bird in the forest, nobody will force you to fly at 9 o'clock.


## Wide roles
We don't have titels, predefined career paths, you-do-that-part-on-the-project things.
